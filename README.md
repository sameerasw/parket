# parket

minimal tiling window manager for macOS.

parket uses swift and public macOS APIs. no private API, no SIP modifications, zero dependencies.

it emulates workspaces by moving windows offscreen and tiles windows with a dwm-style master-stack layout.

inspired by [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) and [AeroSpace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace).

## install

```bash
brew tap basuev/parket
brew install --cask parket
```

or build from source:

```bash
make install
open /Applications/parket.app
```

grant permissions in system settings -> privacy & security when prompted, then relaunch.

## requirements

- macOS 14+, Apple Silicon
- accessibility permission
- input monitoring permission

## features

- **workspaces** - 9 virtual workspaces via offscreen window hiding
- **master-stack tiling** - new windows auto-tile in dwm-style layout
- **monocle layout** - per-workspace fullscreen mode, toggle with option+m
- **menubar indicator** - badge widgets show active workspace and occupied ones
- **custom keybindings** - bind any key combo to shell commands via toml config
- **multi-monitor** - per-display workspaces, each monitor has its own workspace set
- **app switcher follow** - command+tab to a hidden workspace window opens that workspace
- **crash safety** - all windows restore on exit

## keybindings

macOS command+tab stays the system app switcher. when it selects a window on another parket workspace, parket opens that workspace and focuses the selected window.

| key | action |
|-----|--------|
| `Option + 1-9` | switch workspace |
| `Option + Shift + 1-9` | move focused window to workspace |
| `Option + J/K` | focus next/prev window |
| `Option + Return` | swap focused window with master |
| `Option + Tab` | switch to last active workspace |
| `Option + M` | toggle monocle layout |
| `Option + ,` / `Option + .` | focus prev/next monitor |
| `Option + Shift + ,` / `Option + Shift + .` | move window to prev/next monitor |

all keybindings are configurable - see configuration below.

## configuration

edit `~/.config/parket/config.toml`. all fields are optional - defaults are used for anything not specified.

```toml
workspace_count = 9
master_ratio = 0.55
modifier = "option"    # "option", "control", or "command"

[bindings]
focus_next = "j"
focus_prev = "k"
swap_master = "return"
toggle_layout = "m"
focus_monitor_prev = "comma"
focus_monitor_next = "period"
move_monitor_prev = "shift+comma"
move_monitor_next = "shift+period"
last_workspace = "tab"

[[custom]]
key = "shift+return"
command = "open -n -a Terminal"

[[custom]]
key = "shift+b"
command = "open -n -a Safari"
```

custom bindings always include the modifier key (option by default). prefix with `shift+` to add shift to the combo.

to reload config at runtime, use the "Reload Config" option in the menubar menu.

## update

```bash
brew upgrade --cask parket
```

or from source:

```bash
make install
```

replaces only the binary - permissions persist.

## uninstall

```bash
brew uninstall --cask parket
```

or:

```bash
make uninstall
```

parket is not trying to compete with these projects. it exists for those who want the absolute minimum: a single layout, a few keybindings, zero dependencies, and code small enough to read in one sitting.

## resource usage

parket is designed to stay out of your way. here is how it compares to AeroSpace under identical conditions (Apple Silicon, macOS 26, 6 tiled windows, continuous open/close workload):

- **2x less memory** - 41 MB vs 83 MB
- **near-zero CPU** - 0.0% even during active window management, vs 2% for AeroSpace
- **40x fewer context switches** - less work for the kernel, less energy spent

fewer threads, fewer wakeups, longer battery life. you won't find parket in Activity Monitor unless you go looking for it.

<sub>measured with `scripts/benchmark.sh`. run it yourself - numbers are reproducible.</sub>
